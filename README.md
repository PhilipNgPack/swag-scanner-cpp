SwagScanner is a device that can scan your small/medium-sized objects into the virtual world. The system is designed
 and built from the ground up. I designed the software pipeline to be extensible, robust, and fast. SwagScanner is 
 compatible with any depth camera--just verify its minimum scanning distance and acquire the correct mounting hardware 
 and API and you're good to go. You can find more information about the design process and challenges
  on [my website](https://www.seanngpack.com/swagscanner/).

### Status
This is the C++ codebase of Swag Scanner. Currently in development. Expect massive improvements in
codebase design, performance gains, and results.

### Dependencies
* pcl 1.11
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl
$ cd pcl
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
```

* opencv4
```
brew install opencv
```

* librealsense
```
$ git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense
$ cd librealsense
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
```

* feeling-blue-cpp
```
$ git clone https://github.com/seanngpack/feeling-blue-cpp
$ cd feeling-blue
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ sudo make install
```

### Commands

| --scan          | --calibrate     | --process       | --move       |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| --name (string) | --name (string) | --name (string) | --to (int)   |
| --deg (int)     | --deg (int)     |                 | --by (int)   |
| --rot (int)     | --rot (int)     |                 | --home (int) |

Examples:

Start a scan called "scan1" at 15 degree intervals.

```--scan --name scan1 --deg 15```

Run a calibration with an autogenerated name (because you didn't pass --name) at 8 degree intervals 12 times

```--calibrate --deg 8 --rot 12```
